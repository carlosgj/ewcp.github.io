## Executive summary
This document represents EWCP's vision for the achievable scientific and technological advancements to be made within the youth STEM competition community, and especially the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) community, within the next five years.

This open-source research agenda is primarily developed by members of EWCP, a group of current and former FIRST adult participants, through discussion with peers in the FIRST community and with professional colleagues. EWCP's mission is to develop the sustainability of competitive youth STEM teams and strengthen the diversity, robustness, and impact of the youth STEM education community through strategic advocacy, expert consensus-building, and technical leadership.

## Need for this document
Insufficient emphasis on group science:
- Loss of community built around ChiefDelphi whitepapers and photos, as cd-media was not implemented upon the forum's switch to Discourse
- Limited scientific value of the FIRST Championship Conferences
- Lack of an academic journal specifically serving the youth competitive STEM community

## Goals of this document
- Define the current cutting edge of FRC
- Steer the scientific goals of the community to advance the cutting edge
- Improve coordination between teams; reduce wasted effort while encouraging coopertition
- Help teams understand where their innovative work fits within a larger context
- Provide basis for statements about the relative priority of certain research
- Provide support to teams seeking funding for high-priority research
- Generally promote scientific thought, especially with regards to information originating from FIRST and FRC suppliers

### FRC
### AWD.WFA.01
Compare word frequency in the corpus of winning and non-winning Woodie Flowers Award / Finalist Award submissions.

### AWD.WFA.02
Compare gender diversity in the corpus of winning and non-winning Woodie Flowers Award / Finalist Award Submissions and assess geographic equality. 

### AWD.WFA.03
Compare career diversity in the corpus of winning and non-winning Woodie Flowers Award / Finalist Award Submissions and assess geographic equality. 
(Did you know - no female WFA’s are career engineers? They are all teachers. Compared to the 50/50 split between male career engineers and male teachers). 

### AWD.DL.11
Compare gender diversity in the corpus of Dean’s List Finalists & assess according to geographic area for equality. 

### AWD.DL.12
Compare submission rates (is it possible to get this data?) by region to determine the % of students nominated in a specific region. 
Pull out regional vs District data.

### GDC.001
Computationally predict GDC responses to arbitrary Q&A questions.

### Other areas of research interest
- CAD
- Networking
- 3d printing
